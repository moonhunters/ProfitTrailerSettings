    // Bollinger Bands (BB) are a good indicator of if a pair is currently undersold or oversold.
    // The bands are used to gauge how high or low prices are relative to previous prices.
    // Bollinger Bands are based on a moving average - typically, 20 periods - with upper and
    // lower bands two standard deviations above and below the moving average.

    // Simple Moving Average (SMA) is calculated by adding the closing price of a pair for a number of
    // time periods and then dividing this total by the number of time periods.
    // SMA is used to identify current price trends and the potential for a

    // Exponential Moving Average (EMA) is a type of moving average that is similar to a
    // simple moving average (SMA), except that more weight is given to the latest data.
    // It's also known as the exponentially weighted moving average. An EMA reacts faster
